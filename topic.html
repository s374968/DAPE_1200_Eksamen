                    <p class = "p">Our first task was to create three fictional characters. As there are three of us in the group, we distributed it by having each person create an individual character.  We soon noticed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">anime</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">films</a> that we have previously seen heavily influenced the characters. Having compared the characters, we chose “Satoru” as our character.<br><br></p>

                    <p class = "p">
                        Satoru is a 28-year-old Japanese man living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">Tokyo</a>. He is university educated and is a teacher. Satoru has a slightly complicated personality, as he is also an arrogant teacher who claims to be the best. While he is playful with friends and close colleagues, he is also apathetic and cruel towards those he deems unintelligent. Outside of work, he enjoys drinking and cooking for himself. <br> <br>
                        
                        We agreed upon choosing the mobile phone as our modern technology. Satoru’s largest barrier would likely be poor time management, as he would constantly scroll through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">social media</a>. This can be linked to the barrier of sleep disruption. Uncontrolled use of the mobile phone can harm our amount of sleep if we use it too much at night. This can quickly become addictive, especially when the phone is always available. Scrolling through the internet leads us to the next barrier, the feeling of lack of knowledge.<br><br>

                    <p class="p">
                        As previously mentioned, Satoru likes to cook for himself. It doesn't take much before he finds out how many recipes are out there or, for instance, how many teaching techniques he should have used.  He may get the feeling that he always has to keep up to date with the best techniques or trigger his insecurities about being a great teacher. Another barrier could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">fake information</a>.<br> <br> 
                        
                        It doesn't take much for Satoru to find a teaching technique that doesn't produce the effect it claims. Access to an extensive amount of information could also influence Satoru to fall into the barrier of procrastination and lead him to forget his work. On the other hand, access to the mobile phone and the internet could lead him to the barrier of never being able to disconnect from work, as he always takes his “work” home. <br> <br>
    
                        Another barrier could be impaired self-image after using social media. After seeing other teachers being praised over the internet, Satoru may get thoughts doubting his teaching expertise. In addition, the barrier of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">cyberbullying</a> can lead to an increase in these thoughts. It doesn’t take much for students to decide to bully the teacher online. A barrier that could support this is a lack of privacy. Students could find the teacher posting inappropriate statuses/pictures on the internet, which gives them a greater basis for the bullying.<br> <br>
                        
                        Let's say they have not given the students such a basis for the bullying. A new reason could arise with the barrier of identity theft. An unpleasant student could have created a fake account of the identity of Satoru and posted inappropriate statements online. As we can see, the last three barriers are based on the internet giving people the opportunity to be negative without responsibility.  <br> <br>
                        
                        The mobile phone does not necessarily have to lead to poor time management, it can after all, have the opposite effect if used right. For example, Satoru can create reminders that help him plan his time better. As for the barrier of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">sleep disruption</a>, he can either set an alarm for when he should stop using the phone, or have it lock after 9 pm. The solution to the barrier of lack of knowledge may be difficult for some, as it requires some self-control from the user to not constantly search for new information.<br> <br>

                    <p class="p">
                        False information, on the other hand, has an easier solution. You can confirm the information by comparing it with other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">sources</a> regarding the same topic. Sometimes, it also helps to ask yourself if the information seems right or makes sense. Like the lack of knowledge barrier, the procrastination barrier also requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">self-control</a>, as the person himself must prioritize things after priority. The barrier of never being able to disconnect from work could also be tough to overcome. A solution could be to ignore work e-mail outside of work. The barrier of impaired self-image is unfortunately a popular barrier that many people experience. <br> <br>
                        
                        We often compare ourselves to others, which we shouldn't. The solution to this barrier should be a mindset of self-improvement. Cyberbullying often occurs because of a lack of privacy. Cyberbullying is unfortunately not something we can control directly, but one solution could be to be more anonymous online. Securing and making your account private can prevent the lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy" class = "fotoLink" target="_blank">privacy</a>, as well as preventing identity theft. <br><br>
